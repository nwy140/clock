Lively Wallpaper Open-source app

Music Autoplay is disabled by default until the wallpaper is clicked near the bottom edge of the screen    

This repository is a fork of another clock.js repository with some basic digital clock functionality,    
plus some of my own front-end changes    

When previewing on a browser,
for best experience, use a chromium based browser

If a web-app doesn't load properly in Lively Wallpaper  
Install an electron version of that web-app as a desktop app
