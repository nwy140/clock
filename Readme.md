Lively Wallpaper Open-source app

Music Autoplay is disabled by default until the wallpaper is clicked  

This repository is a fork of another clock.js repository with some basic digital clock functionality,  
plus some of my own front-end changes  



If a web-app doesn't load properly in Lively Wallpaper
Install an electron version of that web-app as a desktop app
